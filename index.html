    <p>
      FILLING STATION. The name seems to refer to a gas station but it actually refers to the historic 50's type diner located at 5012 P. Burgos St. in Makati. The restaurant is the brainchild of an ex-US navy chief cook who decided not to move back to the US when the base contract was not renewed. He resolved to put up a place similar to the diners in the 50's in the United States complete with posters from that era, an oil barrel, and 50's type working telephones, 50's type radios, television sets and movies. The place serves aside from the usual burgers, fries and shakes, continental dishes such as steaks, schnitzels, pizza and pasta. Dishes were named after cars and oil companies to give the place the ambiance of a real filling station like Ford for fish and chips, and Texaco for Caesar's salad. All time Filipino favorites like pancit canton, crispy pata, barbecues and Mexican Food are also available. But it didn't stop there. Late in 1997, with the company's continuing pursuit to improve the quality of the food, service and facilities,Filling Station was able to expand from twelve tables initially, to a thirty-eight table caf√© complete with four billiard tables including a VIP room (also known as Marilyn's room). A bigger oil barrel bar was constructed to accommodate and better serve the patrons. So whenever you want to relax and enjoy friendly game of Pool or when the day calls for a filling meal, PLAY, DRAIN, and REFILL at the Filling Station! We also serve the coldest beer in town.
